# Augmented-Random-Search

Augmented Random Search is truly one of the most mindblowing algorithms people have come across with their research in reinforcement learning.

Augmented Random Search(ARS) is actually up to 15 TIMES FASTER than other algorithms with higher rewards in specific applications!

One of the ways, ARS is able to be so much faster is that unlike a lot of reinforcement learning algorithms that use deep learning with many hidden layers, augmented random search uses perceptrons! There are fewer weights to adjust and learn, but at the same time, ARS manages to get higher rewards in specific applications!

Using ARS I decided to train a half cheetah to walk.

So at first, you will see that the agent barely lasts for a couple seconds before falling and the episode ends. A little bit later on, it’s able to balance, but it doesn’t understand quite how to walk using legs. Finally nearing the end of the training, the agent understands how to balance and use legs to push itself forward. Although these were short peeks into what the agent was doing, you can clearly see the progress from not being able to balance, to not moving, to finally balancing and moving to walk!

I have attached the final result of the AI learning to walk! I trained this agent on just my average laptop… imagine what we could do with hundreds of GPUs and computing power! The implications are indefinite and very powerful!
