# Augmented-Random-Search

Augmented Random Search is truly one of the most mindblowing algorithms people have come across with their research in reinforcement learning.

Augmented Random Search(ARS) is actually up to 15 TIMES FASTER than other algorithms with higher rewards in specific applications!

One of the ways, ARS is able to be so much faster is that unlike a lot of reinforcement learning algorithms that use deep learning with many hidden layers, augmented random search uses perceptrons! There are fewer weights to adjust and learn, but at the same time, ARS manages to get higher rewards in specific applications!

Using ARS I decided to train a half cheetah to walk.
